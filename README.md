## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Problem Creater's Organization
Government of Punjab

## Theme
Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution
Develop a smart, AI-driven advisory platform tailored to the needs of small and marginal farmers. Key features:
Personalization: Recommends crops, fertilizers, and practices based on soil, weather, and previous yields
Localization: Supports regional languages and dialects
Accessibility: Works on basic smartphones with voice support
Integration: Combines real-time weather data, satellite imagery, and market information
Scalability: Designed to scale across districts with different cropping patterns and conditions

## Technical Approach
Technologies:
AI/ML for advisory engine and image recognition (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)
Mobile app frameworks (e.g., React Native, Flutter)
Cloud-based infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Azure)
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Text-to-Speech APIs for multilingual and voice support

Implementation Workflow:
User registration with location and crop details
Soil and weather data integration via APIs or manual input
Real-time advisory engine generates insight
User interacts via app or voice assistant
Feedback and performance tracking for continuous improvement

## Feasibility and Viability
Feasibility:
High mobile penetration in rural India
Availability of government soil and weather data
Growing acceptance of digital tools post-COVID
Challenges:
Low digital literacy
Limited internet in remote areas
Farmer resistance to adopting new technology
Mitigation Strategies:
Offline app capability
Local language voice assistant
Community-level training via NGOs and extension workers

## Impact and Benefits
Economic: Higher income due to better yield and cost reduction
Social: Improved decision-making, reduced dependency on middlemen
Environmental: Lower chemical usage, better soil health, sustainable practices
Policy: Supports government initiatives like Digital India, Soil Health Cards, and PM-KISAN
